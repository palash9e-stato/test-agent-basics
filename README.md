**AI AGENT** for random QUOTE genration.




This n8n workflow collects user information through a simple form and stores it in Airtable. Based on the user’s selected profession, the workflow routes the data through different logic paths to assign a predefined rating. After that, the user’s details are sent to a Google Gemini AI agent, which generates a short two-line personalized quote. The generated quote is then written back into the same Airtable record, completing the automated cycle from form submission to AI-powered output. This workflow demonstrates how form inputs, conditional logic, database updates, and AI generation can work together seamlessly in n8n.
